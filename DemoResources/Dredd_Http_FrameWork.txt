Disadvantages
- Manual handshake of contracts not available
- OpenApi 3 in Experimental Stage (Although we were able to perform most of the operations)
- Consumer contracts have to be manually written including identification of all possible states of resource used by each consumer. In Micro Service Architecture this could mean generating a high number of consumer driven contracts
